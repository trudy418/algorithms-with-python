# Algorithms with Python [In progress]

This repository contains Python implementations of different famous algorithms and data structures.
I created it to figure out how they work and to make an example of everything.

## Algorithms

## Plan

- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Greedy best-first search
- A* search
- Minimax (Alpha-Beta Pruning, Depth-Limited Minimax)
